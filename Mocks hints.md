# ToDo App Mocks Hints

## Menu screen

- How can we ensure the user only enters a number and not a letter?
- How can we ensure it's a valid number and not one which isn't shown in the list?

## "Add an item" action

- There are a couple of ways to solve this. A while loop seems like the easiest solution.

## "Remove an item" action

- The length of the list is variable as users add and remove items. How can we print a numbered list which always has the correct numbering based on the current number of items in the list?
- hint: for loop

## "Prioritize an item" action

- It looks like we're printing the entire list as a numbered list again. How can we reuse the code we wrote to accomplish this same thing in the Remove function without just copying that code into the Prioritize function?

## "Show my list" action

- It looks like we're printing the entire list as a numbered list yet again. How can we reuse the code we wrote to accomplish this same thing in the Remove and Prioritize functions without just copying that code into the Show function?
